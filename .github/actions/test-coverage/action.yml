# This action is used to test the coverage of the mobile repo
# It will download the coverage result from the main branch and compare it with the current branch
# If the coverage is lower than the main branch (1% or more), it will post a warning along with
# the coverage report to the PR.
# If this action is run on the main branch, it will upload the coverage result to the main branch
# It will also generate a run id and cache it, so that the next time the action is run in the PR, 
# it will use the cached run id to download the coverage result from the main branch
